I collaborated with 5 software engineers in an Agile Scrum environment to create an Android application for computer science students at the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC). The app helps students plan events and determine if they have qualified for a Program of Study (POSt). Our team participated in daily stand-up meetings to discuss challenges in developing the app and ensure that each member was held accountable for their contributions. We also used Git to manage branches and track code changes, as well as priortized tasks with the Jira backlog.
