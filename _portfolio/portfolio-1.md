I analyzed the shot attempts and game-winning goals of 471 National Hockey League (NHL) forwards using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify high-scoring players in close and tied games. I also developed a random forest model with Scikit-Learn to detect top goalscorers. The model achieved an 88% recall and 97% 10-fold Cross-Validation mean, despite the dataset's negative imbalance. Each player's statistics in pivotal moments and ranking is displayed on a Power BI dashboard.
