I am entering my third-year as a Statistics student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, where I am pursuing a [Specialist in Statistical Machine Learning and Data Science](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/specialist-program-statistics-science), alongside a [Major in Mathematics](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/major-program-mathematics-science). I am actively seeking Co-op opportunities in data analytics, data science, or machine learning for Fall 2024.

I have a strong passion for statistical analysis and Machine Learning. My expertise involves using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to analyze data and develop machine learning models. I am currently expanding my knowledge of deep learning by exploring PyTorch and TensorFlow.

My current interests lie in sports analytics. I recently conducted [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380347690_Analysis_of_NHL_Goalscoring_in_Critical_Situations) on the performance of NHL players in close and tied games, and I developed a classification system to discern their goalscoring in critical game scenarios.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I have a passion for teaching mathematics. I launched a [two-part mathematics course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/shakeel-jivraj/) to help students improve their skills in pre-algebra.

I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in my academic and professional endeavors. As I continue with my undergraduate studies, I hope to expand my knowledge of data science and machine learning. Thank you for visiting my website.
