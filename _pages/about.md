I am entering my third-year as a Statistics student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, where I am pursuing a Specialist in Statistical Machine Learning and Data Science, alongside a Major in Mathematics. 

I have a strong interest in statistical analysis and machine learning. My expertise involves using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to analyze data and develop machine learning models. I am currently expanding my knowledge of deep learning by exploring PyTorch and TensorFlow.

My current interests lie in sports analytics. I recently conducted [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380347690_Analysis_of_NHL_Goalscoring_in_Critical_Situations) on the performance of NHL players in close and tied games, and I developed a classification system to discern their goalscoring in critical game scenarios.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I have a passion for teaching mathematics. I launched a [two-part mathematics course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/shakeel-jivraj/) to help students improve their skills in pre-algebra.

I'm actively seeking Co-op opportunities in data analytics, data science, or machine learning for Fall 2024. Feel free to connect with me at: [shakeel.jivraj@mail.utoronto.ca](shakeel.jivraj@mail.utoronto.ca)
