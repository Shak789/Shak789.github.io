Traditional National Hockey League (NHL) statistics simply focus on the number of goals scored by players, overlooking their performance in critical situations, such as close or tied games. This research aims to identify NHL players who excel in scoring goals during pivotal moments and establish a classification system to discern their performance in critical game scenarios. Using data retrieved from the NHL API, such as Shot Attempts Percentage (SAT%) and Unblocked Shot Attempts Percentage (USAT%) observed during close and tied game situations, alongside game-winning goals, a ranking system was constructed to evaluate NHL players based on their ability to score goals in critical game contexts. In addition, a random forest binary classification model was developed to categorize players based on their metrics in critical situations. As a result of the high negative imbalance in the dataset, various methods such as precision and recall, as well as class weightings, were employed to assess the accuracy of the model. While the model was reliable in correctly identifying top NHL goalscorers during pivotal game situations, further research is needed to determine its predictive accuracy in classifying players.
